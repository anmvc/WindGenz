[22:09:31] [Server thread/WARN]: [SuperVanish] Please include this information
[22:09:31] [Server thread/WARN]: [SuperVanish] if you report the issue.
[22:09:31] [Server thread/WARN]: [SuperVanish] IMPORTANT: Please make sure that you are using the latest dev-build of ProtocolLib and that your server is up-to-date! This error likely happened inside of ProtocolLib code which is out of SuperVanish's control. It's part of an optional invisibility module and can be removed safely by disabling ModifyTabCompletePackets in the config. Please report this error if you can reproduce it on an up-to-date server with only latest ProtocolLib and latest SV installed.
